Usage: process-run [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SEED, --seed=SEED  the random seed
  -P PROGRAM, --program=PROGRAM
                        more specific controls over programs
  -l PROCESS_LIST, --processlist=PROCESS_LIST
                        a comma-separated list of processes to run, in the
                        form X1:Y1,X2:Y2,... where X is the number of
                        instructions that process should run, and Y the
                        chances (from 0 to 100) that an instruction will use
                        the CPU or issue an IO
  -L IO_LENGTH, --iolength=IO_LENGTH
                        how long an IO takes
  -S PROCESS_SWITCH_BEHAVIOR, --switch=PROCESS_SWITCH_BEHAVIOR
                        when to switch between processes: SWITCH_ON_IO,
                        SWITCH_ON_END
  -I IO_DONE_BEHAVIOR, --iodone=IO_DONE_BEHAVIOR
                        type of behavior when IO ends: IO_RUN_LATER,
                        IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE
  -c                    compute answers for me
  -p, --printstats      print statistics at end; only useful with -c flag
                        (otherwise stats are not printed)
